# Rick & Morty Characters viewer
This is a small app that lets you see and add to your favorites the characters from the show Rick & Morty.

It's made with Type **Typescript** script and **React**. I've used the react hooks and redux toolkit to store the favorites.

To run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skatedan/Rick-Morty.git

cd rick-morty

npm install

npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
